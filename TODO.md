# TODO list

* Research stuff beyond second object lists in xxyyFFFE file.
* Research type 08 texture lookup files.
* Complete research of type 02 model group files.
* Render rotation/position of "nested" type 02 model groups correctly.
* Apply tracked head position correctly with OVR.
* Apply curvature warp to models.
* Implement texture lookup 8 solid color textures.
* Properly implement Model::needsDepthSort.
* Cull landblock and landblock objects.
* Preserve original image formats where possible when uploading to OpenGL.
* Either find method to blit into an array texture, or use something other than an array texture for models to avoid scaling/force decompression on the CPU.
